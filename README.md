## About

This repository was originally created to write R code that was complementary to the "Decision Modelling for Health Economic Evaluation" course. See this website for further information about the course:

Excel versions of the models used throughout the course are available here: 

We then used this code to aid in writing our tutorial paper entitled "". 

### Repo Layout

This repo has the original course code, including exercise questions, templates and solutions. It also has summary R scripts that are cited in the aforementioned paper.
